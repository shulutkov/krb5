Kerberos 5 implementation in pure go.

## Thanks

This library literally could not exist without [Jonathan Turner](https://github.com/jcmturner). We are unaware of the 
circumstances but his activity on GitHub seems to have ceased which is a significant loss for the community. Ultimately
this is his org, and we're just the current stewards.

## Support

![Go version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.25-brightgreen.svg)

This library; unless otherwise explicitly expressed; will officially support versions of go which are currently
supported by the go maintainers (usually 3 minor versions) with a brief transition time (usually 1 patch release of go,
for example if go 1.21.0 is released, we will likely still support go 1.17 until go 1.21.1 is released). These specific
rules apply at the time of a published release.

This library in our opinion handles a critical element of security in a dependent project, and we aim to avoid backwards
compatibility at the cost of security wherever possible. We also consider this especially important in a language like
go where their backwards compatibility when upgrading the compile tools is usually flawless.

Changes to the supported version of go in the positive direction (i.e. older versions deprecated and newer versions
added) **_will never_** be considered a breaking change for this library.

This policy means that users who wish to build this with older versions of go may find there are features being used
which are not available in that version. The current intentionally supported versions of go are as follows:

- go 1.27
- go 1.26

### Mutual Authentication

RFC 4121 lets a client ask the service to prove who it is: the service answers the AP_REQ with an AP_REP that only a
holder of the service key could have produced. As an initiator, request it with the `spnego.MutualAuthentication()`
option and check the service's reply with `SPNEGO.VerifyMutual`:

```go
s := spnego.SPNEGOClient(cl, spn, spnego.MutualAuthentication())

ct, err := s.InitSecContext()
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Send ct, then verify the token the service answered with.
if err := s.VerifyMutual(reply); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

The request travels twice in the AP_REQ, as `GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG` in the authenticator checksum and as the
`MUTUAL-REQUIRED` AP option, and acceptors differ in which they read: MIT krb5 answers with an AP_REP only when the
AP option is set. Whichever way a token is asked for it, the option, `gssapi.ContextFlagMutual` or
`flags.APOptionMutualRequired`, it carries both. As an acceptor, `SPNEGOToken.ResponseToken` builds the reply.

### Credential Delegation

RFC 4121 Section 4.1.1 lets a client forward a ticket-granting ticket to the service it authenticates to, so the
service can act as the client against a third party. This library implements both halves.

`gssapi.ContextFlagDeleg` forwards unconditionally. `gssapi.ContextFlagDelegPolicy` forwards only where the KDC
said the service may receive it, by setting `OK-AS-DELEGATE` on the service ticket; where the two disagree the
policy flag wins, and a service ticket that is not in the client's cache is treated as not permitted. Prefer the
policy flag against Active Directory, where `OK-AS-DELEGATE` reflects whether the account is trusted for
delegation. Note that neither flag reports back whether forwarding actually happened, since this library has no
`ret_flags` equivalent.

As an initiator, request it with `gssapi.ContextFlagDeleg` or, for the SPNEGO client, the `spnego.Delegation()`
option:

```go
s := spnego.SPNEGOClient(cl, spn, spnego.Delegation())
```

This requires a forwardable TGT: set `forwardable = true` in the `libdefaults` section of `krb5.conf` before
authenticating, or the KDC will refuse to issue the forwarded ticket. This library defaults the setting to `false`.
Delegating grants the service complete use of the client's identity, as RFC 4120 Section 2.6 describes, so request it
only against services trusted with that. If the TGT is not forwardable the failure is local and matchable:
`errors.Is(err, client.ErrNotForwardable)`.

Note that a forwarded ticket is obtained fresh for every token created, because the credential is bound to the
service it is delegated to and is deliberately not cached. Each token creation therefore costs one extra TGS exchange
with the KDC, and for the SPNEGO HTTP client that is one extra KDC round trip per request.

As an acceptor, a delegated credential arriving on an AP_REQ is attached to the `*credentials.Credentials` that
`service.VerifyAPREQ` returns. Retrieve it with `credentials.DelegatedCredentials()` and load it into a client with
`client.NewFromCCache`, where `conf` is the `*config.Config` the service was built with:

```go
if cc, ok := creds.DelegatedCredentials(); ok {
    delegated, err := client.NewFromCCache(cc, conf)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Act as the client with delegated.
}
```

The principal named inside that credential cache is asserted by the peer, not vouched for by the KDC: it comes from
the `pname` and `prealm` of the delegated `KRB_CRED`, whereas the identity in `creds` comes from the KDC-sealed
encrypted part of the ticket. Nothing compares the two, matching MIT's `rd_cred.c`. A forged ticket is useless
without the matching session key, so this is not a way to impersonate anyone, but a service that authorises on
`creds.UserName()` and then acts through the delegated cache may be acting as a different principal than the one it
authorised. Compare them yourself if that matters to your authorisation model.

### Protocol Transition and Constrained Delegation

MS-SFU lets a service obtain a ticket to another service in a user's name without the user taking part: S4U2Self
gets a ticket to the service itself for a user it authenticated by other means, and S4U2Proxy turns that into a ticket
to a service the KDC lists for it. The service that receives the result sees the user, and the PAC the KDC computed
for the user, just as if the user had authenticated in person.

`client.Client.Impersonate` runs both exchanges; `S4U2Self` and `S4U2Proxy` are there for callers who need one of
them. The result goes to the SPNEGO client with the `spnego.OnBehalfOf` option, which also names the user in the
authenticator, as RFC 4120 Section 3.2.3 requires of an authenticator presented with such a ticket:

```go
imp, err := cl.Impersonate(types.NewPrincipalName(nametype.KRB_NT_PRINCIPAL, "alice"), "EXAMPLE.COM", "HTTP/api.example.com")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

s := spnego.SPNEGOClient(cl, "HTTP/api.example.com", spnego.OnBehalfOf(imp), spnego.MutualAuthentication())
```

The KDC decides, with two separate permissions on the requesting service. Without trust to authenticate for
delegation (MIT's `ok_to_auth_as_delegate`) the S4U2Self ticket is not forwardable and `Impersonate` stops with
`client.ErrEvidenceNotForwardable`; a target outside the delegation list (MIT's `krbAllowedToDelegateTo`) is the KDC's
refusal, recoverable with `errors.As` as a `messages.KRBError`. The tickets are not cached by the client, because they
are in another principal's name; cache the `Impersonation` yourself until its `EndTime`. Only a user and a target of
the client's own realm are supported.

Tested against MIT krb5 1.20 (S4U2Self; its db2 back end refuses S4U2Proxy for every client, MIT's own `kvno -P`
included) and against a KDC implementing both exchanges.

### Tested Scenarios

The following is working/tested:

* Tested against MIT KDC (1.6.3 is the oldest version tested against) and Microsoft Active Directory (Windows 2008 R2)
* Tested against a KDC that supports PA-FX-FAST.
* Tested against users that have pre-authentication required using PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP.
* Microsoft PAC Authorization Data is processed and exposed in the HTTP request context. Available if Microsoft Active Directory is used as the KDC.
